# Login

Welcome to my recent projects.

In this project I have created a Login Page. You can create create an account, check which users have been created and many more fucntions.
You cant create an account with an email/username that is being used. It also has guards so it proetcts it from being accessed from people who hasn't logged in.

With this project I have used Angular for my front-end, .Net 6 for my back-end and SQL for my database.
I also used a Micro-Orm instead of entity framework.
